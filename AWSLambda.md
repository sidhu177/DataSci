# AWS Lambda
## Things to know about Lambda

AWS Lambda is a purely compute resource that allows users to deploy code directly and not worry about infrastructure maintenance. Think of it as pushing just the python script as opposed to instantiating the EC2 and updating the OS, maintaining security patches, installing the language with dependant libraries and then running your code. Lambda does away with all of that. Just Fire and Forget.
